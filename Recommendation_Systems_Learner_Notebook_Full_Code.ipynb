    "# **Marks: 40**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the project on Recommendation Systems. We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## **Context:**\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business.\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "## **Dataset:**\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n",
    "- **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We **will not use this column** to solve the current problem"

    "### 🔍 Dataset Insights\n",
    "- The dataset contains **117,315 ratings** from **1,540 unique users** on **39,939 unique products**.\n",
    "- Ratings are heavily skewed: the **majority of ratings are 5**, indicating strong user preference.\n",
    "- Many products have **very few ratings**, which may impact the performance of item-based models.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Model 1: Popularity-Based Recommendation System\n",
    "- Products with **highest average ratings** were ranked.\n",
    "- When using a low threshold (e.g., `min_interactions = 1`), many top products had **only 1–2 ratings** — unreliable.\n",
    "- With thresholds of **≥50 or ≥100 ratings**, the recommended products were more consistent and trustworthy.\n",

    "**✅ Conclusion**: Simple, interpretable, and best suited for **new users or anonymous visitors**.\n",

    "   - Cold-start users (new to the system)\n",
    "   - Anonymous users\n",
    "3. Consider **item-based collaborative filtering** when item interactions are denser than user activity.\n",
    "4. Build a **hybrid recommendation system** combining:\n",
    "   - SVD (latent factors)\n",
    "   - Popularity (simple fallback)\n",
    "   - Item/User-based CF (contextual similarity)\n",
    "5. Apply **interaction count thresholds** when recommending popular items to ensure reliability.\n",
    "6. Explore additional models:\n",
    "   - **LightFM**\n",
    "   - **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**\n",
    "   - **Content-based filtering** (using metadata or product text)\n",
    "7. Improve further by:\n",
    "   - Adding **more features** (e.g., categories, timestamps)\n",
    "   - Using **Bayesian optimization** or **randomized search** for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "   - Continuously **retraining with new data** to maintain performance\n",
